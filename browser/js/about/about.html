		Tearget began with a woman who desired to possess the tears of a goat.  Sadly she quickly discovered that goats do not have tear ducts.  She decided she would have to settle for the tears of a man instead.  Soon all of her friends and acquaintances were begging her for tears.  She invited a few friends along for the adventure and Tearget was born.  We have quickly amassed a large selection of quality artisans who willingly supply their tears.  If you want to own the tears of a man we are the right site for you!
